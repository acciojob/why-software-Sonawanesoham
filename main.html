<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform lives. The ability to create something from scratch, to solve complex problems, and to see the impact of my work in real-time is incredibly fulfilling. Software development offers endless opportunities for innovation, continuous learning, and collaboration. I want to be a part of this dynamic field where creativity meets technology, where I can contribute to building solutions that make a difference in people's lives.</p>
